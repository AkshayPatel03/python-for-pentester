## Introduction

This repository contains a set of Python scripts aimed at facilitating common tasks in penetration testing. Each script is located in its respective subdirectory and is designed to perform a specific function that is often required during a penetration test.

## Sub Repositories

### SSH Brute Force

This script attempts to brute force SSH login credentials using a list of usernames and passwords.

- **Location**: `SSH_bruth_force/`
- **Usage**: `python ssh_brute_force.py`

### Directory Enumeration

This script enumerates directories and files on a web server using a wordlist.

- **Location**: `directory_enumeration/`
- **Usage**: `python directory_enumeration.py`

### File Downloader

This script downloads files from a given URL.

- **Location**: `file_downloader/`
- **Usage**: `python file_downloader.py`

### Hash Cracker

This script attempts to crack hashed passwords using a dictionary attack.

- **Location**: `hash_cracker/`
- **Usage**: `python hash_cracker_tool.py`

### Key Logger

This script logs keystrokes on the target machine.

- **Location**: `keylogger/`
- **Usage**: `python keylogger_tool.py`

### Network Scanning

This script scans the network to identify active devices and open ports.

- **Location**: `network_scanner/`
- **Usage**: `python network_scanner.py`

### Port Scanner

This script scans a target host for open ports.

- **Location**: `port_scanner/`
- **Usage**: `python port_scanner.py`

### Subdomain Enumeration

This script enumerates subdomains for a given domain using a wordlist.

- **Location**: `subdomain_enumeration/`
- **Usage**: `python subdomain_enum.py`
